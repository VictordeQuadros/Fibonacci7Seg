Section (2.1) - Missing Sources
-------------------------------
None


Section (2.2) - Unknown Sources
-------------------------------

The following ISE design sources referenced in the XISE file are not recognizable in the
current version of PlanAhead. Please read the recommendation on how to resolve this issue:-

<ISE Filename>              <File Type>  <Recommendation>
"TrabSchematic.sch"         'SCH'        Locate the associated top-level HDL file for this schematic source in the ISE project
                                         and import it into the current project as RTL source. In case this associated HDL
                                         functional model 'TrabSchematic.vf/vhf' is not present in the ISE Project, you may
                                         want to generate this model in ISE by running the "View HDL Functional Model" process
                                         under "Design Utilities" and add the generated file to the current project.

Section (2.3) - IP Import Issues
--------------------------------
None


Section (2.4) - Unknown Properties
----------------------------------

The following ISE properties were not mapped into the current project:-

Note: The "Property Specification in Project File" property in the ISE project was set to "Store non-default values only".
      To make the ISE default properties available for import into PlanAhead, please set the value to "Store all values" in
      ISE Project Design Properties and create a new project.

<ISE Property Name>  <ISE Property Value>
None


Section (3) - MAPPED DATA
-------------------------

The following sub-sections describes the list of items that were imported from the
ISE properties and sources and mapped into the current project:-

Section (3.1) - Target Device
-----------------------------

Default Part = xc3s1000ft256-5
Family       = spartan3
Package      = ft256
Speed Grade  = -5


Section (3.2) - Filesets
------------------------

VERILOG_DEFINE = 
VHDL_GENERICS  = 

File(s):-
None

<constrs_1>
FILESET_TYPE   = Constrs

Note: During the import operation, any constraint file(s) that are found in the ISE project will be added to the current PlanAhead project.
      However, please note that none of these files will be automatically marked as a "Target Constraint File". To set a constraint file
      as target, select the file in the GUI "Sources" window, right-click on this file and then select "Set Target UCF". Alternatively,
      the target constraint file can be set using the "set_property target_constrs_file <filename> <fileset>" Tcl command.
